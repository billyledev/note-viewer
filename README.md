# Note Viewer

A simple webapp to load your Onyx Boox Note backups. All the code is running on the client side.  

You can find an online demo running [here](https://billyledev.github.io/note-viewer/index.html).

It is based on Vue.js framework and uses OnsenUI components.  
Additionally, this project uses [SQL.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js) and [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) libs.  
Linting is done with ESLint using the AirBnB style.
